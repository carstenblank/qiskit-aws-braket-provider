# qiskit-aws-braket-provider

Attention: this is a work-in-progess implementation. 
What this means: it basically works. But: 

 1. edge cases are not covered 
 2. even broad cases aren't entirely covered!! 
 3. in code documentation is not thre
 4. no usage or API documentation exists
 5. CI/CD is not setup

__So__: use at your own risk. 

# Contribution
