Attention: this is a work-in-progess implementation. 
What this means: it basically works. But: 
 a) edge cases are not covered 
 b) even broad cases aren't entirely covered!! 
 c) in code documentation is not thre
 d) no usage or API documentation exists
 e) CI/CD is not setup

So: use at your own risk.
